# ACS330 Multi-Robot Collaboration - Group 1

Efficient coordination of a multi-robot team is the key challenge in robotic application domains such as manufacturing, construction and service robotics. In cooperative manipulation tasks, the system dynamics result from the complex interaction of several manipulators handling a common object. However, the widespread use of robots in flexible factories  is limited by the robots’ inability to safely collaborate with one another. The robots’ incapacity to coordinate, communicate, and understand their actions, roles, and task statuses thus decreases the robots’ usefulness in applications where tasks cannot be completed by a single robot. This limitation is driven by both the absence of tools and protocols needed for describing collaborative functions.

This project shall look at the creation of a sophisticated model-based control algorithm for the effective and efficient interaction of multiple robots into their production processes.
